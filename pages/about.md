## About the Collection

Weâ€™re working on this project in partnership with Alma|Lewis, a nonprofit art gallery and organization dedicated to Black art and culture. In addition to curating gallery exhibitions, they offer residencies and fellowships for up-and-coming Black artists and scholars, building and empowering a strong creative community.
Alma|Lewis is currently developing The Black Archive, a library collection of books, academic publications, and artworks connected to or about Black art and art history that will be available as a resource for scholars, researchers, and artists.
As part of this larger project, they want to create an easy-to-maintain online catalog so visitors to their website can view and search the archive contents online.
